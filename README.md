# Submission Path Visualizer ðŸ“ˆ

When submitting a paper to a conference, we all dream of that glorious acceptance email. But let's face itâ€”sometimes reviewers just don't recognize true genius when they see it. ðŸ¤·

So why not plan ahead? If your masterpiece doesn't make the cut this time, which conference should you dazzle next? This simple Python script helps you visualize possible submission paths, turning rejection into mere redirection!

## Features

- **Visualize Submission Paths**: See all your potential conference options laid out beautifully.
- **Plan Ahead**: Strategize your submission timeline like a pro.
- **Stay Positive**: Because every "no" is one step closer to a "yes" (and a fancier conference badge).

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- [`networkx`](https://networkx.org/)
- [`pyvis`](https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/)

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install networkx pyvis
```

## Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You'll be prompted to input the number of days from now when your paper will be ready to submit. If you've already submitted your paper (kudos to you! ðŸŽ‰), just enter `0`.

## Example

```plaintext
Please enter the days from now you want to submit your paper: 30
```

## Getting Help

This script is maintained by nobody now, but you can always raise an issue if you encounter any problems. Or better yet, fork the repo and make it your own!

Remember, every great scientist faced rejectionâ€”it's just fuel for your next breakthrough (or at least a good story at the conference after-party). Happy submitting!
